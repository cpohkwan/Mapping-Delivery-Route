## Our Long and Expensive Delivery Route

This is a mapping project that I did as a Lede 2022 student under the guidance of Aaron Reiss.

It's inspired by my delivery experience as a small home-based business owner - at a time when fuel costs have increased sharply largely due to the embargo of Russion oil.

The story includes a **scrollytelling** section. The map was done in *Geojson.io** and **Datawrapper** first before it's exported as a SVG file for further refinement in **Adobe Illustrator**.

I used **ai2html** scripts to generate the codes for different layers of the map, before combining them with a **Scrollama** template prepared by Jonathan Soma. I added **D3** codes to animate specific points on the map, with the help of David Ng.

Hope you'll enjoy the story!
